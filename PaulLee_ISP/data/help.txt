Ley learns Vim!
===============
This program teaches Vim in a form of a maze, and tests the user's knowledge in a game.

Maze of Learning
================
There are five stations to visit in the maze. Each station teaches a Vim skill. Only after you visit all station, the user may leave the maze.

Game of Testing
===============
The game creates a limited Vim environment for the user to try out their new Vim Skills.
Your objective is to delete all unwanted text displayed in red.
If a line is "clean" (does not have any errors), the line will be removed.
Periodically a new line with errors will be added to the screen.
If the screen fills up with text, you lose.
Your performance is measured by how long you last.

Good Luck!

Exit by typing ":q".
