Station #1 - Welcome to VIM!
============================
First of all, what is VIM? VIM is just a text editor.
What makes VIM special? It allows the user to be more efficient.
How? It forces the user to only use keyboards. (No more mouse!)
The time it takes for the programmer to move their hands back and forth between the mouse and the keyboard is long and is not a good use of time.
VIM also allows you to define keyboard shortcuts to accomplish repetitive tasks faster.
Not being able to use mouse may sound daunting, but after getting some time getting used to, it will get easy.

A key concept in VIM is modes. There are selveral modes, but the most important modes are: NORMAL and INSERT.
NORMAL mode listens for VIM keyboard shortcuts.
INSERT mode inserts the keystrokes made by the user into the file.

By default, VIM starts in NORMAL mode.

To move the cursor on the screen while in NORMAL mode use 'hjkl' keys.
Pressing h moves your cursor left.
Pressing j moves your cursor down.
Pressing k moves your cursor up.
Pressing l moves your cursor right.

These keys will work in the maze.
To exit this station, press ':q'.
