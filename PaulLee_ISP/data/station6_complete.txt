Station #6 - The End
====================
Congrats! You have reached the end of the maze.
I (the creator of this maze a.k.a. Paul Lee) hope you learned the basics of VIM.
The next part of this game, the game of testing, creates a less-than-minimal VIM environment to test your skills.

Please remember that VIM is a very complex topic, and this game only scratches the surface.
I hope that this game will inspire you to try out VIM and even incorporate VIM into your daily lives. >:)

Please feel free to return to the maze to refresh your memory of VIM concepts.

P.S. While VIM is a good text editor, Neovim (another text editor) is better.
There are selveral reasons for this, but they are out of scope for this game.
