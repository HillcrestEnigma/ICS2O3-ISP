Station #4 - Motions and Operators
==================================
It's time that you learn about VIM motions and operators.
Motions are a way to select parts of the file you are editing relative to the location of your cursor.
There are many motions, but to list a few of them:
'w' selects characters from the cursor until the start of the next word after the word the cursor is currently on EXCLUDING the first character.
'e' selects characters from the cursor until the end of the word that the cursor in on INCLUDING the last character.
'$' selects characters from the cursor until the end of the line INCLUDING the last character.

While in the NORMAL mode, pressing these motions will move the characters to the end of the selected characters.
However, when mixed with VIM operators, motions become more useful.

Simiarly, there are many operators in VIM. One of them is 'd'.
'd' is for deleting. When you type 'de'. VIM deletes all the characters selected by the 'e' motion.

For example, When your cursor is on 'A' when you are editing 'ABCDE FGHIJ', pressing 'de' will result in ' FGHIJ'.
This is because VIM deleted from 'A' to 'E'. Since from 'A' the end of the word is 'E'.

This is just an introduction to VIM motions and operators.
These motions and operators will not be supported in the maze.
