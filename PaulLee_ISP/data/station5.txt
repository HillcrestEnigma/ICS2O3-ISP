Station #5 - Inserting
======================
How do you insert text in VIM?
In the NORMAL mode, the characters entered by the user will not show up on the text file.
To insert text, you must enter the INSERT mode.
How? When in the NORMAL mode, press "i". This will place you in the INSERT mode.
In the INSERT mode all keystrokes will be inserted into the text file, until you press the escape key, which places you back into NORMAL mode.

This is a short station.
Exit this station by typing ':q'.
Good luck!
