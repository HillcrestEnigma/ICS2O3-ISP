Station 3 - Deleting Text
==========================
Answer for question from Station #2: ':w'

Wondering how to easily delete text in VIM?
Introducing.. 'x'!
Simply move your cursor over the character you want to delete, and press 'x'. (In NORMAL mode)
Then watch as VIM magically deletes the character the cursor is on.

Want to delete 3 characters?
Press '3x'. Watch as VIM deletes three characters below and to the right of the cursor!
Amazing, right?

When you type a number (x) before you press one of the VIM operators (more on this later),
VIM repeats this operator x times.

What is a VIM operator? An operator is a specific action that you do to your file.
'x' is one of the operators. There is other operators such as 'd', but this it out of scope in this game.

These operators are not supported in this maze.

To exit, type ':q'.
