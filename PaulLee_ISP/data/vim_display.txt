This is a
(bad) VIM emulator.
Feel free to try out
the concepts you learned.
Your objective in this
game is to delete all
text highlighted in red.
Good luck!
To exit the game, type
':q'. >:) -Paul
The following is just
random text for you to
test your VIM skills on.
Note that this VIM
environment is very
lacking, and does NOT
implement all the
concepts taught in the
maze. To try out VIM, get
an actual VIM. :)
This game is actually
open-sourced! Check it on
Github. OWO UWU Please
submit PRs so I can
improve the game. :D
