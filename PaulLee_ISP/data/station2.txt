Station #2 - Exiting VIM and other stuff.
=========================================
Congratulations! You have used the hjkl keys to move your cursor! (Or in this case that weird purple guy)
By now you may be wondering why you had to press the keys ':q' to exit Station #1.
By default, this is how you exit the VIM editor. Although you have to press enter after typing ':q'.
The ':' keystroke causes VIM to enter the COMMAND mode if you are in the NORMAL mode
The COMMAND mode listens for commands.
'q' is a command for exiting the VIM editor. It only works when you have not made any modifications on the file you are editing.
Together ':q' is a command for exiting VIM.
If you made some modifications on the file that you are editing, but would like to NOT save them, issuing the command ':q' will display an error.
To override this error message ':q!' command is used.
If you would like to save your modifications the ':wq' command is used. 'w' is a command for saving. Simply, the 'wq' command saves, then quits immidiately after.
Try to guess which command is used to save to the file you are editing but not quit the VIM editor. The answer will be revealed in station #3.
NOTE: These commands won't work in this game, except for the ':q' command. Also typing ':Q' won't work. If typing the command don't work, you may have typed the command with the wrong capitalization.
Your objective in this maze is to get to all five stations (The colored rectangles) (You already have visited 2 stations) and exit by getting to the pink rectangle at the end. Good luck!
